##checking the accuracy of built model
 The MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R-Squared metrics are mainly used to evaluate the prediction error rates and model performance in regression analysis.
MAE (Mean absolute error) represents the difference between the original and predicted values extracted by averaged the absolute difference over the data set.
MSE (Mean Squared Error) represents the difference between the original and predicted values extracted by squared the average difference over the data set.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is the error rate by the square root of MSE.
R-squared (Coefficient of determination) represents the coefficient of how well the values fit compared to the original values. The value from 0 to 1 interpreted as percentages. The higher the value is, the better the model is.
The above metrics can be expressed,
